6. Corporate Meeting Room Training
Prompt: Create a photorealistic vertical image (4:5) of a modern Indian corporate meeting room with transparent glass walls showing a natural cityscape or greenery outside. Inside, 4–6 professionally dressed Indian employees (both men and women, mid-20s to late 30s) are seated around a sleek conference table. They are engaged in a collaborative discussion led by a confident Indian mentor or team leader standing or seated slightly apart but visibly guiding the team. The team appears attentive, some taking notes, others interacting with laptops or digital tablets displaying online learning content. The scene should clearly suggest a corporate training or online learning discussion. Use a wide-angle perspective to show the full room context. Lighting should be soft and natural, highlighting a professional atmosphere. The top 20% of the image should be left clean and clear with soft dark blue gradient tones fading down, allowing space for manual text overlay. The bottom area can include visual cues like digital learning dashboards, training icons, or a subtle digital screen projection to reinforce the theme. Avoid any close-ups or holographic elements. Keep the color palette modern with dominant dark blue gradient and soft neutrals, maintaining realism and Indian cultural professional aesthetics.

The hall should have transparent side windows with soft daylight coming in, showing city buildings outside. The upper 20% of the image should be a clean, soft dark blue gradient fading downward to allow text overlay.
